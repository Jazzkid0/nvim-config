Literally just my config for neovim. Feel free to steal, there aren't many weird keybinds.

Copilot has a few quirks I still need to iron out. I'm using <C-_> for completion but I'd recommend changing that if you're sane.

<leader> is set to spacebar, change this in remap.lua if you don't want that

Useful binds to know:

<leader>pv : File view
<leader>pf : Fuzzy find files

<leader>a : Harpoon mark file
<C-w> : Check harpoon marks

<C-h,j,k,l> : Instantly move to harpoon files

As always, :x or :q! to exit nvim :)
